Notes - 

1. Absolute Xpath starts always with "//" - means anywhere inside the document

2. Xpath With Contains
	When to use - First -> id = #hqf_test_123 after refresh -> id = #hqf_test_124
	then xpath will be ->//input[contains(@id,'#hqf_test_')]
	
3. Xpath with Contains Text function
	When to use - there is no id, name, classname attribute available & element having particular text
	then xpath will be ->//input[contains(text(),'iphone')]
	Note - it will also find the elements having some other text with word iphone in it
	
4. Xpath with Text 
	When to use - element having particular text
	then xpath will be ->//input[text()='iphone')]
	Note - it will find specifically the element having iphone text available
	
5. Xpath with "starts-With"  
	When to use - First ->  id = test_123 after refresh -> id = test_124
	then xpath will be -> //input[starts-with(@id,'test_')]
	

6. Xpath with "ends-With"  
	When to use - First ->  id = %456_test after refresh -> id = %457_test
	then xpath will be -> //input[ends-with(@id,'_test')]

7. Xpath with index
	When to use - there are more than one elements pointing to a xpath having already unique properties
	URL - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/
